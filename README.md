# t00rProject

**t00rProject** is a modern, AI-powered project management tool designed to be the antithesis of projection—focusing on real-time collaboration, efficiency, and cutting-edge technology. Inspired by tools like Dart, notProjecting enhances project management with AI-driven task breakdown, media generation, Solana blockchain integration, and self-generating AI agents that collaborate like a professional team.

The name "t00rProject" is a playful nod to the tool’s focus on actionable, real-time insights rather than mere projections.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Task Management**: Automatically break down tasks using DeepSeek for deep research and analysis.
- **Self-Generating AI Agents**: Dynamically create AI agents (e.g., researcher, designer, developer) that collaborate on tasks.
- **Inter-Agent Collaboration**: Agents communicate and share updates via a message queue, simulating a real team.
- **Media Generation**: Generate images and videos for project documentation using Stable Diffusion or similar models.
- **Solana Integration**: Manage blockchain-based projects with wallet authentication and smart contract deployment.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Use WebSockets for live task updates and brainstorming sessions.
- **Website Deployment**: One-click deployment to Netlify or Vercel for project sites.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL (via Supabase or similar)
- **AI Models**: DeepSeek for research, Stable Diffusion for images, AutoGen/LangChain for AI agents
- **Blockchain**: Solana Web3.js
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or AWS SQS for agent communication
- **Deployment**: Docker, Netlify/Vercel, GitHub Codespaces for development

## Setup Instructions

### Using GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
1. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces.
2. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
3. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npx ts-node src/index.ts

Configure the database using a cloud service like Supabase.
Using Cloud Services
AI Models: Integrate with cloud APIs like Hugging Face for DeepSeek or Stable Diffusion.
Message Queue: Use managed services like AWS SQS for agent communication.
Database: Use Supabase or Firebase for managed PostgreSQL.
Usage
Creating a Project: Use the dashboard to create projects and assign tasks.
AI Assistance: Leverage DeepSeek for task analysis and AI agents for automated collaboration.
Blockchain Features: Connect your Solana wallet for authentication and project management.
Media Generation: Generate images or videos directly from task descriptions.

### Step 4: Add Essential Files
In addition to the README.md, you’ll need to create the following files to kickstart development:

- **frontend/**: Contains the React application.
  - `README.md`: Brief description of the frontend.
  - `src/`: Source code for the UI (you can start adding files here in Codespaces).
- **backend/**: Contains the Node.js/Express server.
  - `README.md`: Brief description of the backend.
  - `src/`: Source code for the API and agent logic.
- **docs/**: Documentation for the project.
  - `README.md`: Overview of documentation.
- **docker-compose.yml**: For containerizing the application (optional if using cloud services).
- **.env.example**: Template for environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

You can create these files directly in GitHub’s web interface or in Codespaces.

### Security Reminder
- **Token Management**: If you’ve shared any GitHub tokens in the past, consider revoking or deleting them for security. You can generate a new token with limited scopes if needed for future automation.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables within your cloud environment (e.g., Codespaces or Vercel).

### Next Steps
Once the repository is set up:
1. **Start Development**: Use Codespaces or another cloud IDE to begin coding the frontend and backend.
2. **Integrate AI Models**: Connect to cloud-based AI APIs for DeepSeek and image generation.
3. **Set Up Agent Collaboration**: Implement the message queue for AI agents to communicate.
4. **Test Online**: Use cloud tools like StackBlitz or CodeSandbox for frontend testing and Vercel for backend deployment.

This plan ensures your project is built entirely online, leveraging the latest technologies while maintaining a fast, user-friendly experience.
