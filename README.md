# t00rProject

**t00rProject** is a modern, AI-powered project management tool designed to be the antithesis of projection—focusing on real-time collaboration, efficiency, and cutting-edge technology. Inspired by tools like Dart, notProjecting enhances project management with AI-driven task breakdown, media generation, Solana blockchain integration, and self-generating AI agents that collaborate like a professional team.

The name "t00rProject" is a playful nod to the tool’s focus on actionable, real-time insights rather than mere projections.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Task Management**: Automatically break down tasks using DeepSeek for deep research and analysis.
- **Self-Generating AI Agents**: Dynamically create AI agents (e.g., researcher, designer, developer) that collaborate on tasks.
- **Inter-Agent Collaboration**: Agents communicate and share updates via a message queue, simulating a real team.
- **Media Generation**: Generate images and videos for project documentation using Stable Diffusion or similar models.
- **Solana Integration**: Manage blockchain-based projects with wallet authentication and smart contract deployment.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Use WebSockets for live task updates and brainstorming sessions.
- **Website Deployment**: One-click deployment to Netlify or Vercel for project sites.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL (via Supabase or similar)
- **AI Models**: DeepSeek for research, Stable Diffusion for images, AutoGen/LangChain for AI agents
- **Blockchain**: Solana Web3.js
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or AWS SQS for agent communication
- **Deployment**: Docker, Netlify/Vercel, GitHub Codespaces for development

## Setup Instructions

### Using GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
1. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces.
